## 1. Introduction to Engineering Drawing

Engineering drawing is the **fundamental language of mechanical engineering**, used to communicate design intent, dimensions, and manufacturing details. In this module, I studied the **basics of engineering drawing**, including drawing conventions, standards, and visualization techniques.

I developed a clear understanding of **orthographic projection**, where a three-dimensional object is represented using multiple two-dimensional views such as the **front view, top view, and side view**. I also studied **isometric projection**, which provides a pictorial representation of objects while maintaining proportional dimensions.

The concept of **reference planes**—Horizontal Plane (HP), Vertical Plane (VP), and Profile Plane (PP)—and the **orientation of objects relative to these planes** was explored in detail. Based on object position, appropriate views were selected and drawn.

Using a **mini drafter**, I illustrated:
- Four different models
- Seven orthographic projections
- Seven isometric projections

All drawings were prepared according to the provided PDFs, following proper alignment, scaling, and dimensioning standards. This exercise significantly improved my **spatial visualization and technical drawing skills**.

## 2. 2D Drawing and Drafting

2D drafting plays a vital role in converting engineering concepts into accurate technical drawings. Using the **Sketcher workspace in CAD**, I created precise 2D drawings by applying standard drafting practices.

I learned and applied:
- Basic sketch tools (line, circle, rectangle, arc)
- Geometric and dimensional constraints
- Dimensioning and annotation techniques

As part of this module, I constructed a **Level-2 Sierpiński Triangle**, which helped me understand **geometric recursion, symmetry, and mathematical pattern generation** in a CAD environment.

A **proper drawing sheet** was prepared with:
- Standard title block
- Correct scale
- Neatly labelled dimensions

This activity improved my **precision, consistency, and drafting discipline**.

## 3. 3D Drafting

3D drafting involves converting 2D sketches into three-dimensional objects. In this module, I created a **3D model of an Allen key** in Autodesk Fusion 360 using the given dimensions:
- Length: **55 mm**
- Width: **20 mm**
- Size: **3 mm**

The model was developed by sketching a 2D profile and applying **extrusion operations**. A fully labelled **engineering drawing sheet** was then generated from the 3D model.

Additionally, I created **three machine parts** by:
1. Creating accurate 2D sketches
2. Using tools such as **extrude, hole, and fillet**
3. Maintaining dimensional accuracy

This exercise helped me understand the transformation of **conceptual sketches into functional mechanical components**.

## 4. 3D Modelling

### 4.1 Solid Modelling

Solid modelling focuses on creating fully defined, manufacturable parts. I designed a **simple HTOL aircraft airfoil** using Autodesk Fusion 360.

Using suitable plug-ins, a **NACA 2412 airfoil profile** was generated. I studied the **NACA airfoil nomenclature**, where:
- The first digit represents maximum camber
- The second digit indicates the position of maximum camber
- The last two digits represent thickness as a percentage of chord length

I also understood important aerodynamic features such as:
- Leading edge
- Trailing edge
- Chord line
- Camber line

This task introduced me to the **application of CAD in aerodynamic and aerospace design**.

### 4.2 Surface Modelling

Surface modelling is essential for designing complex and smooth geometries. Using the **Forms environment**, I designed a **toroidal propeller** compatible with a **1000 kv BLDC motor**.

This task helped me understand:
- Free-form surface manipulation
- Curvature continuity
- Aerodynamic shaping for reduced noise and vibration

The design emphasized **low-noise propeller characteristics**, which are critical in UAV applications.

### 4.3 Sheet Metal Design

Sheet metal design focuses on manufacturability and efficient material usage. I designed a **postbox for MARVEL** using the sheet metal environment with:
- Thickness: **1 mm**
- Height: **1 ft**

Sheet metal rules, bends, and flanges were applied while ensuring proper **bend allowances and flat pattern generation**. The design considered:
- Ease of fabrication
- Structural strength
- Usability
- Material optimization

This exercise improved my understanding of **practical manufacturing constraints**.

### 4.4 Organic Modelling

Organic modelling allows the creation of smooth, free-form, and aesthetic designs. Using the **Forms tool**, I designed a **hollow vase** based on the given parameters.

This activity helped me understand:
- Surface continuity
- Symmetry
- Artistic control within engineering design

Organic modelling is widely used in **product and industrial design**.

## 5. Assembly and Animation

Assembly modelling is essential for understanding how individual components function together. I learned the **difference between bodies and components** in Fusion 360 and their importance in motion simulation.

I studied:
- **Top-down assembly approach**
- **Bottom-up assembly approach**

Using this knowledge, I designed and assembled a **Ratchet and Pawl mechanism**. Appropriate **joints** were applied, and the mechanism was animated to demonstrate its working principle.

This task helped me understand **mechanical constraints, motion transfer, and functional validation**.

## 6. Spur Gear Design

Gears are widely used for power transmission in mechanical systems. I designed a **spur gear set** with the following specifications:
- Gear ratio: **2:1**
- Number of teeth: **20 and 40**
- Module: **3 mm**
- Pressure angle: **20°**

The gears were created using the **Spur Gear Generator add-in** and assembled using **As-Built Joints**. A **motion link** was applied to simulate correct rotational motion.

This exercise enhanced my understanding of **gear geometry, speed reduction, and torque transmission**.

## 7. Parametric Design

Parametric design enables easy modification of models through defined parameters and constraints. I designed a **parametric box** with multiple lid options using:
- **Slide joints**
- **Snap joints**

Design parameters were defined so that any dimensional change automatically updated the entire model. The assembly was animated to demonstrate its functionality.

This task strengthened my understanding of:
- Design intent
- Constraints
- Reusability
- Efficient design iteration
